### Talison Cardoso

Creative engineer with a hacker's mind and a dreamer's soul. I build mobile apps, optimize routines, design circuits, and occasionally imagine sailing the world. Currently shaping the future — one line of code (and coffee) at a time.
### 👋 Hey there! I'm Talison Cardoso

I'm a mobile developer passionate about crafting smooth and functional digital experiences.  
Currently working with **React Native**, **Expo**, **Firebase**, and other modern technologies — always aiming for clean architecture, great performance, and well-organized projects.

Beyond code, I'm also into maker projects (yep, I mill PCBs with a Roland SRM-20!)  
And I dream of living on a sailboat someday, building creative products that make a real impact.
