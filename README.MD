### About me
I'm from São Paulo, Brazil, and I started programming at the age of 14. My initial focus was on game development using the gameMaker engine. Later on, I pursued a course in Electronics Technician, which introduced me to low-level programming with assembly language.

In 2020, I began a Systems Development Technician course, but unfortunately, it was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I resumed the course in 2021 and successfully completed it in 2022. Currently, I am enrolled in college, further expanding my knowledge in the field.

I have hands-on experience in web development using various technologies such as Python, JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, HTML, CSS, React, React Native, and agile methodologies like Kanban and Scrum.
 - We can programming together!!!
